### hi, I'm Jonathan Segal

I'm currently working on my Ph.D. in Information Science at [Cornell University](https://infosci.cornell.edu/content/segal) and am a member of [AIRLab](https://airlab.cis.cornell.edu/) led by [Dr. Angelique Taylor](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/angelique-taylor/). I am motivated by a future where augmented reality transforms healthcare delivery, particularly by assisting [EMS](https://www.health.ny.gov/professionals/ems/) and other medical professionals in high-stakes situations. Additionally, I am excited about many topics, such as [particle physics](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jonathannsegal_internship-sanfrancisco-slacnationalacceleratorlaboratory-activity-6967628873400299520-J-0m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), [sports analytics](https://sdmay22-35.sd.ece.iastate.edu/), [geospatial data](https://sdmay22-35.sd.ece.iastate.edu/), generative AI, and [startups](https://medium.com/@jonathannsegal/my-startup-in-college-failed-heres-what-i-learned-96fae77921a1).

Previously, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at [Iowa State](https://www.iastate.edu/), where I worked with [Dr. Stephen Gilbert](https://www.engineering.iastate.edu/people/profile/gilbert/) and [Dr. Michael Dorneich](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/dorneich/) at [VRAC](https://www.vrac.iastate.edu/). I spent a summer at [SLAC](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/) working with [Dr. Jeff Shrager](https://sites.google.com/view/jeffshrager-org/home) and [Wan-Lin Hu](https://profiles.stanford.edu/wan-lin-hu). During my summers, I've interned at [BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com/), [Dwolla](https://web.archive.org/web/20230320190202/https://www.dwolla.com/updates/my-crazy-summer-internship/?utm_campaign=Ongoing-Social&utm_content=136222797&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-84909450), and [Corteva](https://www.corteva.com/).
